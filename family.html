    This is my mother. She is the person I love the most because she has sacrificed everything and dedicated her whole life to raise, take care and protect me all this time through thick and thin.
<br>
<br>
 When I was 2 years old, I was diagnosed with congenital rare diseases and it was dificult to find specialists for the treatment that is needed and the appropriate and effective treatment methods 
 <br>
 <br>
 available. My mother decided to quit her job in a bank just to take care of me and raised me full time with all her heart. I would not be able to repay her for what she has sacrificed so far just for
<br>
<br>
 me but but I surely always pray to Allah for her healthiness and a blessed age.
