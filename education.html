    I got my early education in 2 kindergartens. In 2006 when I was 5 years old, I went to kindergarten at Tadika Islam Pasti, Taman Maluri, Kuala Lumpur and moved to Tahfiz Al Munir 
<br>
<br>
Kindergarten when I turn 6, which located nearby.

    Then I started my primary school in Grade 1 in 2008 at <!--Internal Link--> <a href="https://sktamanmaluri.weebly.com">SK Taman Maluri</a>, Kuala Lumpur and finished my Gred  6 at the same school.

    When I was in form 2, my health deteriorated causing me to take frequent sick leave and my mother began to worry because my school was quite far from home. I am in the religious stream and
<br>
<br>
 my school ends in the afternoon around 5-6pm everyday as I have to attend religious classes resulting me in often feel fratique and sick due to lack of rest. As soon as I finished sitting for PT3 
 <br>
 <br>
 exam, my mother decided to transfer me to school closest to my residence, SMK Panchor.

It's easier for my mother to monitor my health condition closely. Furthermore, at new school my class finished at 2.30pm everyday. I was grateful to be surrounded by caring and loving teachers 
<br>
<br>
as well as good friends which always gave me moral support at all time. I was also entrusted to hold position of being School Prefect, The Vice President of English Club, Vice Secretary of 
<br>
<br>
uniform unit, Puteri Islam and a committee member of Chess Club. I sat for SPM in 2018 and thanks to Allah that I obtained a result that can be proud of. I was awarded the Anugerah Pelajar 
<br>
<br>
Akademik Terbilang 2019 for the State category (Negeri Sembilan) and was specially invited to a Certificate of Appreciation event which was presented by the Menteri Besar of Negeri 
<br>
<br>
Sembilan, YAB Dato' Seri Hj Aminuddin Bin Harun. The event was held at Royal Chulan Hotel in Seremban town. I also received A Certificate of Appreciation from SMK Panchor for making
<br>
<br>
 the school proud of my achivement. The ceremony was held at Dewan SMK Panchor and the certificate was presented by YAB Mr Anthony Loke, a Parliament member of Seremban. It was a 
 <br>
 <br>
 very meaningful and memorable moment ever happened in my life that I would never forget.

    I've received an offer to further my studies at <!--Internal Link--> <a href="https://www.uitm.edu.my/index.php/en">UiTM</a> (Diploma in Information Management course) and was placed at Rembau Campus. For the first time of my life, I had to live

    away from family and stay in the campus residence. My life as a university students began and I am determined to achieve my ambitions and make my family proud. Of course, with heavy heart,
<br>
<br>
 my mother had to accept the new changes that were happening in my life at that moment. At university, I started meeting new friends, learns to adapt to a new environment

    and willing to compete for self-improvement. I wanted to prove to everybody who looked down on me that I am also capable to succeed like any normal and healthy people out there. Although I
<br>
<br>
 had to admit that it is surely difficult as I continue to be shackled with unpredictable health problems. I told myself that I would remain strong and continue my steps to move forward without 
<br>
<br>
 turning back and will not easily gave up and succumb to whatever obstacles coming my way. I am very touched to the moral supports that my family gave me even though they are worried about
<br>
<br>
  not being able to always be with be at all time. 
 Time passes quickly. I am now in my final semester, in the final year. I only had the opportunity to follow face-to-face classes in my first year and 
<br>
<br>
 then had to adapt to the current situation of the country plagued by the Pandemic of COVID-19 disease that hit the world in 2019. In the following years, I study by Online Distance Learning 
<br>
<br>
 (ODL) at home. 
 The end of 2021 is very challenging to me as my health is unsatisfactory possibly due some stress that I'm facing as I'm in the final year and exam is just around the corner. 
<br>
<br>
Despite falling sick and being admitted to hospital recently, I will persevere and do the best I can for the final exams coming soon. Please pray for me to be blessed by Allah of a good health, to
<br>
<br>
 be kept away from harm,to be ease in all matters and whatever I do. Aamiin.
